## Tech used

**Design and Development Tools (Frontend):** 
- [(Reactjs)](https://react.dev/): The website relies on React as its primary JavaScript library for constructing the user interface. React is a widely adopted choice for crafting dynamic and engaging web applications.

 - [(ScrollReveal)](https://scrollrevealjs.org/): The ScrollReveal library finds application in introducing scroll-based animations and effects to elements as they become visible while scrolling down the webpage.

 - [(React Icons)](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): Icons from the React Icons library, specifically react-icons, are utilized for presenting icons across various sections of the application.

- [(CSS)](https://web.dev/learn/css/): CSS was responsible for controlling the presentation and layout of web pages as well as implementation of responsiveness and media queries.

- [(API)](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api): The static API data is defined within the client-side codebase, specifically in the data.js file. This data is bundled with the client-side JavaScript code when the application is built and deployed. It's used by the client-side React components to populate and render product listings on the user interface.
