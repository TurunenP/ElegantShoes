## Tech used

**Design and Development Tools (Frontend):** 
- [(Reactjs)](https://react.dev/): The website relies on React as its primary JavaScript library for constructing the user interface. React is a widely adopted choice for crafting dynamic and engaging web applications.

 - [(ScrollReveal)](https://scrollrevealjs.org/): The ScrollReveal library finds application in introducing scroll-based animations and effects to elements as they become visible while scrolling down the webpage.

 - [(React Icons)](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): Icons from the React Icons library, specifically react-icons, are utilized for presenting icons across various sections of the application.

- [(CSS)](https://web.dev/learn/css/): CSS was responsible for controlling the presentation and layout of web pages as well as implementation of responsiveness and media queries.

- [(API)](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api): The static API data is defined within the client-side codebase, specifically in the data.js file. This data is bundled with the client-side JavaScript code when the application is built and deployed. It's used by the client-side React components to populate and render product listings on the user interface.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Prerequisites
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
